         <h1>CAPTAIN VIKRAM BATRA</h1>
         <hr>
    <p>Captain Vikram Batra PVC (9 September 1974 – 7 July 1999) was an Indian Army officer. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military decoration, for his actions during the Kargil War. On 7 July 1999, Batra was killed while fighting Pakistani troops at Point 4875 in the Kargil district of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir.
<h2 id="early">Early life and education</h2>
<hr>
Batra was born on 9 September 1974 in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh to a Punjabi Hindu Khatri family.[1][2] He was the third child of Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. The older of twin sons, he was born fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and 'Kush' (Vishal), after the twin sons of the Hindu deity Rama, by their mother who was a professed devotee of Rama.[3] He had two sisters: Seema and Nutan.[4] As a young child, Batra received his primary education under the tutelage of his mother.[5][6] He received his Primary Education at GPS Tikri-Mushehra (Chauntra-1) in Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh. He then attended the D.A.V. Public School in Palampur, where he studied up to middle standard.[5] He received his senior secondary education at Central School in Palampur.[5][6]<br>
Besides his academic endeavours, Batra also dabbled in a variety of sports at his school, which he represented at the national level during the Youth Parliamentary competitions in Delhi. He also represented his school and college in table tennis, Karate and other such sports. In 1990, he and his twin brother represented their school in table tennis at All India KVS Nationals.[7][6][8][9] He also was a green belt holder in Karate and went on to attend a national level camp in Manali.<br>    
In 1996, he passed the CDS examination and subsequently received a call for an interview at the Services Selection Board (SSB) at Allahabad and was selected.[19] He was among the top 35 candidates in the Order of Merit.[19] After completing a year (session 1995–96) towards the degree of MA in English, he left the university to join the Indian Military Academy.[17][20]<br>
</p>
</div>
    
 
<h2 id="military">Military career</h2>
<hr>
Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June 1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion.[21] After completing his 19-month training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and was commissioned as a lieutenant into the Indian Army.[22] He was commissioned into the 13th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh for regimental training. The training lasted one month, from December 1997 to the end of January 1998.[23]

On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir, an area with significant militant activity.[23] In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry School at Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, where young Army officers are trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This training lasted five months until September 1998. Following completion of the course and being awarded alpha grading, he joined his battalion in Sopore in October 1998.[6][23]<br>

During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed.[24][25] He believed that the bullet was meant for him and not his colleague.[26]

In January 1999, Batra was sent on a Commando Course at Belgaum, Karnataka. The course lasted for two months and at the end of it, he was awarded the highest grading — the Instructor's Grade.[27]<br>

Every time when he came home to Palampur on leave, he would visit the Neugal Cafe.[26] Batra last came home on leave from the army in 1999, during the Holi festival for a few days.[28][26][29]<br>


The town of Dras, the second coldest inhabited place in the world after Siberia, where temperatures fall as low as −60 degrees Celsius in winter.[30][31]<br>
After his leave, he returned to join his battalion in Sopore.[26] The 13 JAK Rif, after completing its counter-insurgency operations tenure in Kashmir under 192 Mountain Brigade of 8 Mountain Division, received orders to proceed to Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The battalion's advance party under Major Yogesh Kumar Joshi had reached its destination, when on 5 June, because of the outbreak of the war, its deployment orders were changed and the battalion received orders to move to Dras.[32][33]<br>

Batra informed his parents about his movement and assured them they need not worry about him.[26][34] He would call his parents at least once in ten days.[26] The last phone call he made was on 29 June 1999. This was the last time that Batra spoke to his mother.[26]<br>

Beginning his service as a lieutenant, he rose to the rank of Captain.

After the capture of Tololing, 13 JAK Rif marched from Dras to Tololing, reaching their destination in 12 hours.[43] Upon reaching, Alpha company of 13 JAK Rif took over Tololing and a portion of the Hump Complex from 18 Grenadiers.[43]</p>

<p>Vikram Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour on 15 August 1999, the 52nd anniversary of India's independence. His father G.L. Batra received the honour for his deceased son from the President of India, the late K. R. Narayanan.[84]

The Param Vir Chakra citation reads as follows:

CITATION
CAPTAIN VIKRAM BATRA

13 JAMMU AND KASHMIR RIFLES (IC 57556)
During 'Operation Vijay', on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company was tasked to attack Point 5140. Captain Batra with his company skirted around the feature from the East and maintaining surprise reached within assaulting distance of the enemy. Captain Batra reorganised his column and motivated his men to physically assault the enemy positions. Leading from the front, he in a daredevil assault, pounced on the enemy and killed four of them in a hand-to hand fight. On 7 July 1999, in another operation in the area Pt 4875, his company was tasked to clear a narrow feature with sharp cuttings on either side and heavily fortified enemy defences that covered the only approach to it. For speedy operation, Captain Batra assaulted the enemy position along a narrow ridge and engaged the enemy in a fierce hand –to-hand fight and killed five enemy soldiers at point blank range. Despite sustaining grave injuries, he crawled towards the enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position with utter disregard to his personal safety, leading from the front, he rallied his men and pressed on the attack and achieved a near impossible military task in the face of heavy enemy fire. The officer, however, succumbed to his injuries. Inspired by his daredevil act, his troops fell upon the enemy with vengeance, annihilated them and captured Point 4875.

Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and leadership of the highest order in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.</p>
